[bubbles of evolving requirements on top of customer's heads get more complex as time goes on]

-------------------------------- iffy,combine theses two -----------------------------------

Today's customers use "modern" and "mobile" technology, in order to always be ONLINE. 
They like to be in control by using products with instant on-demand results to maximize productivity.
[show customers using tech gadgets on the go, at home, using things with instant results, show fast cycling changes]

Studies show they use feature-rich solutions with beutiful visuals for customizing and previewing their designs before ordering.
[good looking websites slide in, customers with tech gadgets slide in and move towards them, ignoring Bill's simple site]



Competition evolves to the needs of customers by providing better functionality to always serve them regardless of what technology they use.
[Blocks representing features move towards other shops, while no blocks move towards Bill's shop]

There are customers around Bill, but because of a lack of modernization and functionality, Bill's business goes unnoticed.
[customers walk past bill and his shop in both directions, Bill's shop looks outdated, tumbleweed rolls by, other shops look modern]
[web2print features slide in, bigger shops with scary looking business people in suits expand beside Bill's shop, and customers go there instead of Bill's shop]

This makes it hard for Bill to get more customers.
[Bill is sad]
