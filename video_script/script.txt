Bill works hard to maintain his business, but times are changing and customers are evolving.
Now a days customers like fancy websites with advanced previewing functionality for their printing needs.

Customers are also on the go with their mobile phones.

Customers are all around Bill but because of a lack of moderization, Bill is not seen by them.

Competitions are growing stronger, they provide better functionality to customers making it hard for Bill to get more customers.

In the modern era, previewing, customization, fancy visuals and ease of use attract customers.
