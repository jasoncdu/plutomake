Bill works hard to maintain his business, but times are changing and customers are evolving with new needs for the current era.
[spinning clock, scenery gets more technical]

Today's customers love fancy but simple solutions with previewing functionality.

In addition, they use "modern" and "mobile" technology, in order to always be ONLINE.

Competition evolves to match the needs of these new customers by providing them with better functionality and visuals to serve them no matter where they are.

Customers are around Bill but because of a lack of modernization and functionality, Bill's business goes unnoticed.
[customers walk past bill and his shop in both directions, Bill's shop looks outdated, other shops look modern]
[web2print features slide in, bigger shops with scary looking business people in suits expand beside Bill's shop, and customers go there instead of Bill's shop]

This makes it hard for Bill to get more customers.
[Bill is sad]
